    "text": "Nature-based and outdoor recreational activities are among the most highly-valued ecosystem services from U.S. public lands, with approximately half of all Americans reported to engage in outdoor recreation at least once per year (Sanchez et al. 2021). The Sierra Nevada in California is a significant area for outdoor recreation, offering diverse landscapes and ecosystems that have attracted visitors for centuries (Hatchett, 2018). Outdoor recreation in the Sierra Nevada, encompassing activities throughout all four seasons, plays a crucial role in supporting the local economy (Streib et al. 2021, Ligare et al. 2011). Annually, over 17 million people engage in recreation within the Sierra Nevada national forests, generating $1.6 billion in expenditures and contributing $1.3 billion in economic benefits to local businesses and communities [REF]. Activities during warmer weather, such as hiking, nature viewing, and camping, make up the majority of this recreation, with winter pursuits like downhill skiing and various other activities also drawing significant participation (Halofsky et al. 2021). The economic value of annual visitation to the Sierra National Forest, for instance, was over 47 million dollars, with $33 million spent by visitors during those trips, and more than $10.3 million towards wages and income of local businesses (Forest Service, 2020). Similarly, Yosemite National Park had total visitor spending of $497,552,000 in 2022, with 6,314 jobs supported, and an economic output of $683,739,000 (Flyr and Koontz, 2023). Beyond material benefits, recreational use plays an important role in promoting mental health and human well-being by providing opportunities for physical activity and engagement with nature (Bratman et al. 2019, Remme et al. 2021). Effective planning, management, and conservation of Sierra Nevada’s forests are crucial to sustaining nature-based and outdoor recreational use.\nRecreational activities depend on local environmental conditions [REFS], with the availability and quality of these opportunities influenced by climatic, biophysical, and socio-economic factors. The tightly coupled link between outdoor recreation and healthy ecosystems underscores the dependency of this nature-based service on ecosystem well-being and its vulnerability to future climate and environmental changes (Manley and Egoh 2022, Underwood et al. 2022, ). Climate change is reshaping outdoor recreation by reducing snowfall, altering migration patterns, and decreasing biodiversity, with significant economic repercussions (Westphal, 2022). Climate change effects are already evident in the Sierra Nevada. Recent droughts have led to an annual loss of approximately $15 million in Inyo National Forest (Sanchez et al. 2021), and the 2013 Rim Fire, burning over 100,000 hectares with about 30% in Yosemite National Park, caused up to $211 million in lost recreation and tourism revenue (Batker et al. 2013). The 2018 Ferguson Fire, which closed Yosemite National Park for three weeks during peak tourist season, resulted in an estimated decrease of $46 million direct and indirect visitor spending in Mariposa County (Wilson et al. 2020). Moreover, a diminishing snowpack endangers California’s $1.2 billion winter sports industry, as shifts towards more rainfall and warmer temperatures affect snow-dependent activities in the Sierra Nevada (Hangenstad et al. 2018, Wood and Jones 2019, Winter et al. 2021). These changes are expected to shorten winter seasons and decrease interest in snow-based sports such as skiing (Wobus et al. 2017). The downhill skiing industry in U.S. National Forests faces potential economic welfare losses ranging from $172 to $374 million (Chapagain et al. 2018). Concurrently, the demand for recreational activities is predicted to rise due to population growth and increased incomes, intensifying the impact of climate change on outdoor recreation (Halofsky et al. 2021).\nNature-based recreation, crucial for ecosystem valuation, remains undervalued in traditional markets (Pascual et al., 2010; Bateman et al., 2013; Hermes et al., 2021). This oversight complicates forest management, essential for balancing recreational and commercial interests. Recent US initiatives aim to integrate the economic significance of these non-market values into national accounts to enhance policy decisions (White House 2023). Recognizing all costs, including non-market use values, is vital for sustainable forest management and preventing resource overexploitation and environmental decline (Costanza et al., 1997; Garrod & Willis, 1999; de Groot et al., 2012). Furthermore, understanding the economic impacts of various recreational activities helps forest managers develop targeted strategies, optimizing resource allocation and enhancing visitor experiences (Cho et al., 2014).\nNonmarket valuation techniques, essential in assessing forests and ecosystems’ economic worth, include stated preference (SP) and revealed preference (RP) methods. SP methods gather data through surveys on hypothetical changes in ecosystem services, while RP methods derive values from actual behaviors and transactions (Johnston et al., 2017; Lupi et al., 2020). The travel cost (TC) method, a type of RP, evaluates nature-based recreation’s nonmarket values by correlating the expenses and frequency of visits to natural sites (Zawacki et al., 2000; Ezebilo, 2016). This method assumes the economic value of these areas reflects in visitors’ willingness to incur travel costs, typically minimal or free for entry. By examining the relationship between travel costs and visitation numbers, analysts can estimate consumer surplus (CS), the benefit users get over what they pay (Freeman et al., 2014; Czajkowski et al., 2015). TC studies may use individual approaches, analyzing specific visitor data, or zonal approaches, grouping data by areas for aggregate demand analysis (Govigli et al., 2019).\nRecent studies have applied the individual travel cost (TC) method to quantify the economic value of visits to forests, focusing on activities like hiking, picnicking, and biking (Pak & Türker, 2006; Cho et al., 2014). For example, Sardana et al. (2016) assessed the value of trips to different sites in Southern US national forests. Alessandro et al. (2023) found that forest visits in Italy offer a consumer surplus (CS) of €7.33 to €17.37 per trip, emphasizing the popularity of hiking. Cho et al. (2014) showed that increases in TC could significantly reduce visitation, particularly among non-trail activities in the Allegheny National Forest. Chapagain et al. (2018; 2021) explored the impact of climate variables on forest visits and calculated a CS of USD 56 to USD 73 for nonmotorized boating in US national forests.\nUnderstanding the drivers of current recreational patterns is important for developing adaptive strategies for future climate impacts. It is also essential to understand how social, environmental, and climatic interactions affect recreational demand to better anticipate changes under varying climate conditions. For instance, Manley and Egoh (2022), found that trail density and the average maximum temperature were the two most influential factors for recreation in non-urban recreation sites in California. This finding underscores the clear connection between social and biophysical systems in shaping recreational demand. Another study highlighted that climate variables like temperature, snow depth, and rainfall are linked to downhill skiing demand; with annual economic benefit of $2.16 to $4.93 billion from downhill skiing, projected changes in these climactic variables could potentially impact the economic benefits from this recreational activity (Chapagain et al. 2018). Wildfire and smoke also impact outdoor recreation, with increasing wildfire activity happening, and expected to increase in frequency and magnitude, when outdoor recreation is also growing in popularity (Gellman et al. 2022). Human-caused warming has led to a substantial increase in wildfire activity in the forests of the Sierra Nevada, and this trend is expected to continue in the coming decades (Williams et al., 2019). The increase in wildfire activities has been particularly pronounced in recent decades, affecting the spatial pattern of wildfires in the Sierra Nevada (Чэн et al., 2021). This has led to changes in vegetation and forest structure, impacting the overall landscape and potentially altering the outdoor recreational experience. These studies underscore the importance of integrating environmental, ecological, and social factors to understand current recreational trends and anticipate changes due to projected climate impacts.\nWe contribute to the expanding research on the link between recreational use in Sierra Nevada national forests, environmental conditions, and the economic valuation of forest visits. Our study differs from previous efforts in two ways. Firstly, we use proxy site visits which represent information collected at a recreation site or area within the national forest, and examine the influence of site-specific historical environmental predictors, offering spatial and temporal insights into forest visitation patterns. Next, we leverage a comprehensive survey dataset to estimate and analyze the economic value of nature-based recreation in Sierra Nevada’s national forests, focusing on how values differ among main activities. Our novel approach categorizes activities into five broad groups, providing a clearer view of recreational preferences than prior studies, which typically examined only a few activities. Our combined approach aids forest managers in making informed decisions, optimizing resource distribution, and crafting strategic adaptation plans. It also establishes a basis for forecasting recreation trends, potentially enhancing science to decision-making processes and education efforts."

    "text": "Methods\n\nRecreational Visitation\nNational Visitor Use Monitoring Program (NVUM)\nThe USDA Forest Service National Visitor Use Monitoring (NVUM) program collects information on visitor use and characteristics in national forests across the United States (English et al. 2002, English et al. 2020). It is a comprehensive initiative that serves two goals: 1) to estimate the number of recreation visits to National Forest units, and 2) to describe visit characteristics including the types of activities conducted, visit duration, demographics, and satisfaction levels, to inform management decisions and ensure that national forests are meeting their legislative mandate to maintain species and community diversity (English et al. 2020). The program aims to gather information on visitor use and characteristics, including demographics, activities, and satisfaction levels, to inform management decisions and ensure that national forests are meeting their legislative mandate to maintain species and community diversity. Visitation at each National Forest unit is estimated on a regular five-year cycle and is reported for the entire forest unit for the entire year (English et al. 2020).\nProxy visitation\nProxy visits are the information collected at a recreation site or area that is directly related to the amount of recreation visitation received. This can come from fee receipts, fee envelopes, mandatory permits, permanent traffic counters, and ticket sales. Fee sites including campgrounds, ski areas, fee demo sites, day-use recreation sites, designated wilderness, backcountry areas, and river permits also constitute proxy visitation.\nProxy sites in the National Forest National Visitor Use Monitoring Program are used as a means to gather data on visitor patterns and activities in protected areas. These proxy sites serve as representative locations within the national forest where data is collected to estimate the volume of recreation use (English et al., 2019). The National Visitor Use Monitoring (NVUM) program classifies settings into four categories: Wilderness, Overnight-use Developed Settings (DUDS), Day-use Developed Settings (OUDS), and General Forest Areas (Sardana et al., 2021). These proxy sites are strategically selected to provide a comprehensive understanding of visitor preferences and behaviors in different types of forest settings.\nWe utilized visitor data, collected at quarterly intervals, from proxy sites in Inyo, Sierra, Stanislaus, and Sequoia National Forests for specific years during the National Visitor Use Monitoring (NVUM) survey periods. The survey was conducted in Inyo and Sequoia National Forests in 2006, 2011, and 2016, and in Sierra and Stanislaus National Forests in 2007, 2012, and 2017. We categorized the quarterly data into seasons: winter (January to March), spring (April to June), summer (July to September), and fall (October to December) for 847 locations between 2005 and 2017. Specifically, within Inyo National Forest, there were 156 “Other Use Designated Sites” (OUDS) and 101 “Day Use Designated Sites” (DUDS); in Sequoia National Forest, there were 122 OUDS and 108 DUDS; Sierra National Forest had 105 OUDS and 75 DUDS; and Stanislaus National Forest had 99 OUDS and 81 DUDS (Figure 1). Visitor data from adjacent national parks, specifically Yosemite, Kings Canyon, and Sequoia, were excluded from this study because comparable visitation estimates for sites within the national parks were not available (i.e., no comparable proxy visit data) (National Park Service, 2024).\n\n\nSite description\nInyo National Forest\nInyo National Forest spans nearly 2 million acres, primarily along the eastern Sierra Nevada. It includes one million acres within nine Congressionally designated Wilderness Areas. The elevation varies from 4,000 feet in the Owens Valley to 14,494 feet at Mt. Whitney, the highest point in the contiguous U.S. The forest offers diverse recreational activities such as camping, hiking, fishing, equestrian trails, and off-highway vehicle paths. Winter sports enthusiasts can enjoy alpine skiing and snowboarding at local ski resorts, over 100 miles of multi-use winter trails, and around 45 miles of trails for cross-country skiing. Attracting nearly 4 million visitors annually, Inyo National Forest is California’s most visited national forest (U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, 2024).\nSierra National Forest\nSierra National Forest is situated adjacent to the west of Inyo National Forest. The forest spans a vast expanse of 1.3 million acres, of which 527 thousand acres are designated as Congressionally-designated five wilderness areas. Elevation ranges between 900 feet and 13,987 feet, featuring terrain that includes middle-elevation slopes that are heavily forested, alpine landscapes, and oak-covered foothills. The forest is distinguished by two nationally designated wild and scenic rivers, three nationally designated trails, and two national scenic byways. Its proximity to Yosemite, Kings Canyon, Sequoia National Parks, and Inyo National Forest, known for their trails, high peaks, rivers, canyons, wilderness, and large trees, makes it a hub of natural beauty, aptly summarized as “United in Breathtaking Tranquility.” Similar to Inyo, the forest provides numerous recreational opportunities, including ski resorts for winter activities.In 2017, Sierra National Forest recorded a total of 611,000 visits per person (USDA Forest Service, 2017).\nStanislaus and Sequoia National Forests\nThe two remaining national forests in Sierra Nevada, Stanislaus and Sequoia, cover 898 thousand and 1.1 million acres, respectively. Stanislaus ranges in elevation from 1,500 feet to over 11,000 feet, while Sequoia ranges in elevation from 1,000 feet to over 12,000 feet. Stanislaus is situated in the northern part of the Sierra Nevada region, whereas Sequoia is situated in the western part. Stanislaus has 78 lakes and 811 miles of streams and rivers, including more than 1,000 miles of hiking trails. The forest thus provides numerous recreational opportunities, including hiking, fishing, hunting, camping, skiing, wildlife-watching, and more. The forest further manages the entire Emigrant Wilderness (113,000 acres) and co-manages the Carson-Iceberg (161,000 acres) and Mokelumne Wilderness Area (105,165 acres). Sequoia National Forest offers 52 campgrounds, 1,147 miles of trails, about 315,000 acres of wilderness, 2,617 rivers and streams, and 158 ponds and lakes. Thus, similar to the other forests in Sierra Nevada, Sequoia offers an abundance of recreation opportunities. According to the most recent numbers, Sequoia National Forest and Stanislaus National Forest have hosted a total of 626,000 and 971,000 visits per person, respectively.\n\nTable 1.

The NVUM program includes a survey data collection process. The survey data collection aims to provide estimates of the extent of recreational utilization of National Forests, including a foundation for the estimation of non-market benefits from recreational visitation (English et al., 2020). Using a survey, recreation staff trained in conducting interviews adhere to a consistent sampling process specific to their forest, collecting visitation data across various sites at the end of each visit. Recruiting subjects at the end of their visit ensures accurate recall of their time spent in the forest and the types of activities they engaged in. Visitation estimates combine this detailed exit survey data with traffic counts, capturing a broad spectrum of information over a year from diverse locations and times within the forest.\nIn the survey, all respondents are asked 27 questions covering the number of visitations to the forest where they were interviewed, the duration of their last visit, socio-demographic information, their zip-code, and whether their visits were primarily for recreation or other purposes. Furthermore, respondents were are asked to identify their main recreational activities during forest visits from a provided list of 29 activities (see Table A.1). Subsequently, they were are asked about the number of visits they made to the forest where they were interviewed in the last 12 months specifically to engage in their main recreational activities (English et al., 2020). The main objective of this study is to assess how recreational behavior and values vary across main activities. However, as the list of main activities in the survey is too comprehensive to analyze variation in recreational behavior and values across all activities individually, we have classified these activities into five broad groups. Passive represents activities associated with seeking to appreciate and enjoy the surroundings without actively participating in more physically demanding recreational pursuits, such as nature viewing, picnicking, and wildlife viewing. Active represents physical outdoor activities seeking adventure, exercise, and a hands-on experience with nature, such as hiking, hunting, and biking. Winter represents winter activities, including downhill skiing, cross-country skiing, and snowmobiling. Camping group represents overnight stays within natural settings, while the Other represents activities, particularly those related to engaging in motorized activities, such as driving for pleasure and motorized trail use. Table A.1 in the Appendix shows all activities classified in the five activity groups.\nDifferent and more extended survey versions are randomized to extract more information about the respondents. For example, a third of the respondents are asked about economic questions (e.g., trip spending), while another third is asked questions about trip satisfaction and stated importance of site aspects. In terms of sampling, the recreation staff only recruit respondents during daytime for safety reasons. As a result, this approach increases the likelihood of excluding night-time recreationists, such as hunters, from the survey. More generally, a stratified sampling approach is applied, subdividing every national forest into 12 strata based on site type and exit use volume (English et al., 2002; Sardana et al., 2016). Each forest contains multiple interview sites, each distinguished by a unique identifier. This information allows us to track the respondents’ points of exit from the national forest they visited.\nThe data we used for the TC model were collected from more than 11,000 visitors at 287 different sites across the four large national forests: Sierra, Inyo, Sequoia, and Stanislaus. Table 1 provides a description and summary statistics of the data. Data collection occurred from Fall 2005 to Winter 2017. From 2016 to 2017, 3,273 individuals were contacted in Inyo, 1,024 in Sierra, 1,769 in Sequoia, and 4,754 in Stanislaus. The respective participation rate was 79 percent in Inyo and Sierra, 76 percent in Sequoia, and 83 percent in Stanislaus.\n\n\nEnvironmental Variables\nMaximum temperature, minimum temperature, precipitation, soil moisture, and wind speed\nFor each proxy site, we analyzed climate and environmental variables using the Climatology Lab’s gridMET and TerraClimate datasets. The gridMET dataset supplied daily temperature (in Kelvin) and precipitation (in millimeters), whereas the TerraClimate dataset provided monthly soil moisture (in millimeters) and wind speed (in meters per second) data. The process began with defining bounding boxes for each national forest and generating custom URLs to access NetCDF data from the Northwest Knowledge Network’s Thematic Real-time Environmental Distributed Data Services (THREDDS) data server. Following this, the gridded data was clipped to match the national forest shapefiles and spatial joins were performed. This entailed calculating the proximity of data points to each proxy site, selecting the nearest points, and integrating these data into the records for each site. The data underwent further processing, which included converting the format from wide to long, standardizing dates to the YYYY-MM-DD format, and adding new year, month, and season columns. The data was also filtered to coincide with the National Visitor Use Monitoring (NVUM) survey years. To ensure consistency in analysis, temperature readings were converted from Kelvin to Celsius, and the data was aggregated to provide monthly and seasonal averages.\nSnow water content\nUsing the cder R package from the California Data Exchange Center (CDEC), we acquired daily snow water content data in inches. This process began with identifying relevant snow stations equipped with sensor 3, which measures snow water content. The coordinates of these stations were obtained via the cdec_search_stations() function and subsequently narrowed down to those within each national forest. Custom queries were generated for these stations to gather daily data within selected time frames. The next step involved spatially aligning this data with the closest proxy sites, based on minimum distance, and integrating these values with each proxy site’s records. Further data processing included converting the datetime column to create new columns for year, month, and season, and filtering the data to align with the National Visitor Use Monitoring (NVUM) survey years. Lastly, the snow water content data was aggregated to yield monthly and seasonal average values.\nFire perimeter\nFire perimeter data, quantified in acres, was sourced from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE). This was achieved by accessing the download URL for a shapefile hosted on ArcGIS Hub, which encompasses all fire perimeters in California. The data was subsequently extracted using R. The tidying process of this data involved filtering the state of California and the records that matched the National Visitor Use Monitoring (NVUM) survey years. Additional columns for month and season were created. The average fire perimeter was calculated for each month and season. Additionally, a spatial join in ArcGIS matched fire incidents to the nearest proxy sites during the NVUM survey years. This process used an ‘intersect’ join type within a 10,000 meter radius, employing a ‘one-to-many’ matching approach.\nElevation\nElevation for each proxy site was calculated using the Summarize Elevation tool in ArcGIS Pro. This tool summarizes the elevation, slope, and aspect information for each proxy site. Elevation values are reported in meters and slope and aspect are calculated and returned in degrees.\nTrail density\nTrail data from the USGS National Transportation Dataset (NTD) for California was used to calculate trail density (square km) using the line density tool in ArcGIS Pro, part of the Spatial Analyst extension. Trail density values were then extract using Extract Values to Points in ArcGIS Pro to retrieve data values from the trail raster layer at each proxy site within the four National Forest units.\nSmoke days\nProvides information on potential exposures to varying intensities of wildfire smoke – light, medium, and heavy categories and is generated from combining data from NOAA’s Office of Satellite and Product Operations Hazard Mapping System’s Smoke Product (HMS Smoke) with the United States Census Block Group Centers of Population. The dataset provides a daily allocation for each of the 220,334 U.S. Block Groups from the 2010 Census, helping identify populations at risk of exposure to wildfire smoke on specific days or computing the potential person-days of exposure over defined periods or spatial units of interest.\nTo extract potential smoke exposure in site types within each national forest, we spatially referenced smoke density and the US census block dataset through reverse geocoding using latitude and longitude of the US census blocks and merged with proxy sites within each forest using Spatial Join based on proximity in ArcGIS Pro."

    "text": "Statistical Analysis\n\nData Preprocessing\nThe data preprocessing phase consisted of three main steps: normalization of numerical variables, identification and quantification of missing values, and imputation of categorical missing data. These steps were implemented in R using the dplyr package version 1.3.1 (Wickham et al. 2023) and tidyr package version 1.3.1 (Wickham et al. 2024), contributing to the data’s readiness for subsequent analysis.\nNumerical features were identified and normalized to ensure uniform scale across the dataset. We applied a range normalization method, scaling each feature to a [0, 1] interval. Following normalization, we assessed the dataset for missing values to gauge data completeness. This step involved tabulating missing entries for each feature, which allowed us to apply targeted imputation strategies effectively, thereby preserving data integrity. Finally, missing categorical data were imputed to maintain the dataset’s analytical validity without introducing bias. The imputation strategy involved assigning a new category level to missing values, and ensuring consistent treatment of NA values. We converted NA values them into a separate category within factor variables, thereby retaining the integrity of the dataset for analysis.\n\n\nRandom Forest Regression\nRandom forest regression is a powerful machine learning technique that combines the principles of ensemble learning and decision tree regression. It operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees during the training phase and outputs the mean prediction of the individual trees for regression tasks (Duroux & Scornet, 2018). Each tree is built on a randomly selected subset of the training data, and at each split, a random subset of features is considered, which enhances the diversity among the trees and reduces the risk of overfitting (Peng, 2022). This approach allows random forest regression to effectively capture complex relationships and interactions within the data, making it particularly suitable for high-dimensional datasets and problems with non-linear relationships (Li & Bradic, 2019). One of the key advantages of random forest regression is its ability to handle large amounts of data with high dimensionality, making it suitable for a wide range of applications in fields such as medicine, environmental science, and finance (Peng, 2022). Additionally, random forest regression is known for its robustness to outliers and noisy data, as the averaging of multiple trees mitigates the impact of individual errors (Duroux & Scornet, 2018). Moreover, it provides a measure of variable importance, allowing for the identification of significant predictors in the regression model (Peng, 2022). Another advantage is its computational efficiency, as it can efficiently handle large datasets and is parallelizable, leading to faster training times (Peng, 2022).\nWe used Random Forest Regression using the H2O package (H2O.ai, 2022) in R to examine the relationship between historical environmental predictors and proxy visitation counts for all national forests. We defined a function to streamline the process of training and evaluating Random Forest models. This function accepts the dataset, model name, and parameters like the target column (‘seasonal_visits’) and seed for train-test splitting to ensure reproducibility. The Random Forest models were trained with these datasets, with ‘seasonal_visits’ at proxy sites within the national forests as the target variable. Each model’s performance was assessed using a dedicated evaluation procedure that computed metrics such as R² (coefficient of determination), MSE (Mean Squared Error), and RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) based on comparisons between predicted and actual values in the test dataset.\nWe generated residual plots and actual vs. predicted plots for each model to visually assess model performance and identify any systematic errors. The residual plot contrasted actual seasonal visits against residuals (differences between actual and predicted visits), highlighting any patterns deviating from randomness. The actual vs. predicted plot facilitated a direct comparison between model predictions and true outcomes, providing a straightforward metric of model accuracy.\n\n\nTravel Cost Empirical Modeling\nFirst proposed by Hotelling (1947), the TC method involves analyzing the relationship between visitation intensity and the TC people incur to visit a recreation site, where the TC is the shadow price for the recreational experience. Individuals are faced with different TCs when visiting a recreational site because they live at different proximities, which is the foundation for estimating the demand for access to the recreation site (Freeman et al., 2014). Individuals are assumed to be sensitive to a higher TC, meaning that when the TC increases, the number of visits (demand for forest recreation) should decrease. In addition to TC, socio-demographic characteristics and other explanatory variables are often integrated into the demand function.\nThe number of visits Y_i individual i took the last 12 months to the visited national forest to engage in their main activities can be expressed by the following demand function:\nYi  = f [TCi,INCi ,hi (Di,Vi,Si)],                          (1)\nWhere TCi is the round-trip cost for individual i, INCi is individual i’s income, and hi is a vector of characteristics, defined by socio-demographic variables (Di ), distance to substitute sites (Si , and activity groups (Vi ).\nAs only one-third of the sample was queried about their income, we utilized the median income in their zip code from census data as a proxy for the respondents’ income, consistent with previous research (see e.g., Lloyd-Smith & Becker, 2020; Sardana et al., 2016). To calculate the TC, we estimated the round-trip distance, in miles, between the respondents’ zip code and the national forest site where they were interviewed. The round-trip distance was then multiplied with average operating costs per mile for a typical sedan-type car in the year they visited the national forest (in 2005, the average operating cost per mile was USD 0.14, while in 2017, this cost was USD 0.18). “Additionally, we included time costs, defined as a third of the median household income in the respondents’’ zip-code area, multiplied by the travel time, assuming an average speed of 50 mph. The income was divided by 2,000 hours, based on 40-hour weeks over a year (Whitehead et al., 2010).\nOverall, TC is then defined as:\nTCi  = 2⋅d⋅oc +1/3⋅I⋅(2⋅d/50mph),                           (2)\nwhere the first part is the driving costs and the last part is the time costs. In Equation 2, distance between the zip code centroid and national forest boundary is defined by d, operating cost per mile is defined by oc, and income is defined by I.\nThe number of visits Yi includes only non-negative integer values and is centered around a few visits, making it appropriate to specify a count regression model. Furthermore, with onsite sampling, Yi excludes observations with zero visits. In the literature, two models for this type of data are commonly used: the truncated Poisson and the truncated negative binomial (NB) regression model. The truncated Poisson model is restricted to modeling count data with the assumption that the mean and variance are equal. With on-site count data, this assumption is often violated, which is called overdispersion. Estimated coefficients are then inconsistent and inefficient. The truncated NB regression addresses the issue of overdispersion and is thus commonly used in the literature (Martinez-Espiñeira & Amoako-Tuffour, 2008).\nAnother issue occurring with on-site sampling is endogenous stratification, where individuals who visit the study site more frequently are more likely to be surveyed. To correct for endogenous stratification, it is common practice to subtract one visit from the total number of visits reported by respondents. To analyze our recreation data, we employ a truncated negative binomial regression model with endogenous stratification, in accordance with literature recommendations, using the user-written command ‘nbstrat’ in Stata 17 (Hilbe & Martínez-Espiñeira, 2005).\nThe model has the following log-likelihood function:\nwhere Γ is the gamma function, α measures overdispersion, and μ is the mean of the distribution. By estimating the model, we can subsequently estimate the consumer surplus, which is defined as the difference between what people are actually willing to pay and what they actually paid for the recreational experience.\nGiven the log-linear form of the demand function, the CS per visit can be calculated as the inverse of the TC coefficient, as follows:\nCS=-1/β_TC .    (4)\nIn line with Bertram et al. (2020), there are two approaches to assess variation in CS across activity groups. Firstly, we examine interaction variables between activity group dummy variables and the TC variable. ” A statistically significant interaction term would indicate that the response of the number of visits to changes in TCs varies among different activity groups, thereby implying variation in CS per visit for each group. An insignificant interaction term suggests that CS per visit remains constant across the observed activity groups. Secondly, we explore whether the activity groups lead to variation in the predicted number of annual visits. Variation in the predicted number of annual visits leads to variations in CS per visitor per year across different activity groups. The corresponding change in CS per year, induced by the different activity groups, can be calculated by dividing the total change in the predicted number of visits by the coefficient of the TC variable.\nTo estimate the TC model, some observations are excluded from the estimations by being recognized as either outliers or having insufficient information to estimate travel distance. More specifically, we excluded respondents who had traveled more than 1,000 miles, consistent with assumptions used in previously published studies (Bin et al., 2005; Chapagain et al., 2018; Chapagain et al., 2021). Also, consistent with previous research (Egan & Herriges, 2006; Sardana et al., 2016), respondents who stated that they had made more visits than once per week within a year, i.e., more than 52 visits in total, were also excluded. To control for endogenous stratification, one visit was subtracted from the total number of visits reported by each respondent. Consequently, respondents who reported only one visit to the forest were removed from the analysis."
